# How it works
In order to do this, you must be running your BeamMP Server on Lua 5.1. As I am currently writing this, Lua 5.1 is only available to early access members, though I could imagine that the public release will be published shortly.

# IMPORTANT
The file must be in the "Resources/Server" directory and MUST MUST BE NAMED "TZNTools". I currently don't have a way too work around this.


# Commands
!ban (username) -- Permabans the user

!kick (username) -- kicks the user

... and much, much more to come later
